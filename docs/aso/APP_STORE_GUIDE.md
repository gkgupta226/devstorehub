# Apple App Store ASO Metadata Guide

The Apple App Store algorithm relies heavily on specific metadata fields. Optimize these to increase visibility.

## 1. App Title (30 Characters Max)
- **Weight**: Highest.
- **Strategy**: Use your most important keywords here. 
- **Example**: `Extracker: App Analytics & ASO`
- **Pro Tip**: Use a colon or dash to separate your brand from your keywords.

## 2. Subtitle (30 Characters Max)
- **Weight**: High.
- **Strategy**: Expand on the value proposition. Don't repeat words from the Title.
- **Example**: `Analyze Competitors & Insights`

## 3. Keywords Field (100 Characters - Hidden)
- **Weight**: High.
- **Strategy**: Use comma-separated words with NO spaces. 
- **Example**: `analytics,competitor,tracker,metadata,optimization,marketing,developer`
- **Pro Tip**: Don't repeat words from Title or Subtitle. Singular form only saves space.

## 4. Description (4,000 Characters Max)
- **Weight**: Low (not indexed for search, but vital for conversion).
- **Strategy**: Focus on the first 3 lines (before the "More" button). Use bullet points for features.

## 5. Visuals (Screenshots & Video)
- **Quantity**: Up to 10.
- **Strategy**: The first 3 screenshots are everything. They must contain captions that explain the benefit.
- **Video**: Use App Previews (max 30 sec) to show gameplay or dashboard navigation.

## 6. App Updates (Freshness)
- Frequent updates (every 2-4 weeks) signal to Apple that the app is healthy.
