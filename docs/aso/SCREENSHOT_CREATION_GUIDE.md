## 2. The Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Capture High-Res Raw Shots
Don't use your physical phone. Use the **iOS Simulator** on your Mac for perfect resolution:
1. Run app in simulator (e.g., iPhone 16 Pro Max).
2. Go to the screen you want.
3. Press `Cmd + S` to save a pixel-perfect screenshot to your desktop.

### Step 2: Use the ASO Logic First
Before opening a design tool, use the **ASO Intelligence Simulator** (the "Add" icon in this app's Search Page):
1. Enter your proposed title.
2. Enter a short description highlighting the screen's feature.
3. Check the "ASO Score" and "Optimization Tips" to ensure your messaging is effective.

### Step 3: Design in Figma (Recommended)
1. **Get a Template**: Search the Figma Community for "App Store Screenshot Template."
2. **Place Raw Shots**: Drop your Simulator screenshots into the device frames in the template.
3. **Add Messaging**: Use the text you validated in Step 2.
4. **Export**: Export as `PNG` or `JPG`.

## 3. Top Secret Design Tips for Developers

### Consistent Padding
Ensure the distance from the device frame to the edges of the screenshot is consistent across all tiles.

### The "Color Pop"
Use a background color that contrasts with the App Store's search background.
- **App Store Light Mode**: Use dark or vibrant backgrounds (Blue, Purple).
- **App Store Dark Mode**: Use light or bright gradients.

### Feature Focus (Zoom)
If a feature is too small to see, **zoom in** on that specific UI element instead of showing the whole screen. A "magnified view" often converts better than a full-page view.

## 4. Final Checklist Before Upload
- [ ] Is the text readable on a small screen?
- [ ] Are the first two screenshots your "Hero" features?
- [ ] Did you include a shot of the iPad version (if applicable)?
- [ ] Is there localized text for different store regions?
