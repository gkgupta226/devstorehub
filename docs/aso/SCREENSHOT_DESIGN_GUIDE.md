# Modern App Store Screenshot Design Guide

Creating high-conversion screenshots is as much about design as it is about messaging. Modern App Store screenshots have moved away from simple device captures toward "Storytelling Tiles."

## 1. Modern Design Trends

### The Panoramic Background
Instead of isolated images, use a continuous background that spans across 2-3 screenshots. This encourages the user to swipe and view more of your app.

### Device Framing
Don't just show the UI. Place it inside a high-quality device frame (iPhone 16 Pro, etc.). 
- **Style**: Use "Soft-UI" or 3D isometric angles for a premium feel.
- **Background**: Use vibrant gradients, abstract shapes, or glassmorphism.

### Hybrid Orientation
While most apps are vertical, some categories (Games/Media) benefit from landscape primary shots followed by vertical details.

## 2. The "3-Second Rule" Hierarchy

Users decide to download or skip in less than 3 seconds. Your first two screenshots MUST communicate:
1. **The Core Value Proposition** (What does it do?)
2. **The Logic/Proof** (How does it work?)

### Typography Tips
- **Contrast**: High contrast (e.g., White text on Dark Gradient).
- **Size**: Text should be legible even in the search result thumbnail.
- **Length**: Maximum 5-7 words per screen. Use "Power Verbs" (Analyze, Build, Scale, Track).

## 3. Visual Example (Modern Aesthetic)

## 4. Technical Specifications (iOS/iPadOS)

| Device | Resolution | Aspect Ratio |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **iPhone 6.7" (16/15 Pro Max)** | 1290 x 2796 px | 19.5:9 |
| **iPhone 6.5" (14/13 Pro Max)** | 1284 x 2778 px | 19.5:9 |
| **iPhone 5.5" (8 Plus)** | 1242 x 2208 px | 16:9 |
| **iPad Pro 13" (Gen 7)** | 2064 x 2752 px | 3:4 |

## 5. Pro Workflow Tools
- **Design Tools**: Figma (Best for layout), Photoshop (Best for effects).
- **Automation**: Use Figma "Components" to sync text across all sizes.
- **Preview**: Use the **ASO Intelligence Simulator** built into this app to see how your draft text ranks before designing!
